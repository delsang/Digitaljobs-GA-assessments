# Digitaljobs-GA-assessments
Weekly assessments and end of bloc projects

These are the different assessments I had to submit during the course. 
Some including "bonus questions" that I created for myself to dig deeper into the subjects.
Most of them have been submitted as Jupyter Notebooks, appart from the ones from the last sessions where we switched to working with the command line.

The main labs consist of 3 projects:
- Create a Study Review App
- Data Analytics
- Use Flask to create an app (I choose to re-use the data from the Study Review App)

Although some parts of the course were fairly easy as I already had a base working with Python in the past, I enjoyed going through the basics again and working on resolving problems in a different way than I might have done in the past, and working on a better syntax / commenting my work.
